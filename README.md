Vignette is a face tracking software for characters using [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). Unlike most solutions, Vignette is:

- Made with osu!framework, the game framework that powers [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu), the next iteration of [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh).
- Open source, from the very core.
- Always evolving - Vignette improves every update, and it tries to know you better too, literally.

## Running

We provide releases from GitHub Releases and also from Visual Studio App Center. Vignette releases builds for a select few people before we create a release here, so pay attention.

You can also run Vignette by cloning the repository and running this command in your terminal.
```
dotnet run --project Vignette.Desktop
```

## Developing

Please make sure you meet the prerequisites:
- A desktop platform with [.NET 5.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.
- Have provided proper credentials to access the [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/vignette-project/packages).

### Setting up GitHub Packages

Open your NuGet Configuration (global or user-scoped) and append this inside the configuration:

```xml
<packageSourceCredentials>
   <Vignette>
      <add key="Username" value="YourGitHubUserName"/>
      <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="YourGitHubPAT"/>
   </Vignette>
</packageSourceCredentials>
```

Your GitHub PAT (personal access token) should have the `read:packages` scope to access this organization's NuGet feed.

- See [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/configuring-dotnet-cli-for-use-with-github-packages) for more information about configuring GitHub Packages for NuGet and .NET.
